# Kavon's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills, built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## About

I help small organizations and underserved communities turn legacy systems and complex data into modern, mobile-first appsâ€”even if they're not sure where to start.
